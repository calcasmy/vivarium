'''
Inside the TerrariumStatus Class:

* __init__(self) (Constructor): This special method is called when you create a new instance of the TerrariumStatus class 
    (e.g., sensor_fetcher = TerrariumStatus()). Its purpose is to initialize that specific instance. In this case, it sets up the connection 
    to the sensor using I2C. It defines how a TerrariumStatus object is set up. It's about the object's initial state.

fetch_data(self): This method is responsible for retrieving the temperature and humidity readings from the sensor. It relies on the sensor object 
    (self.sensor) that was initialized in __init__. It's a behavior that a TerrariumStatus object performs. It's about what a TerrariumStatus object does.

Key point: Both __init__ and fetch_data operate on the specific sensor that a TerrariumStatus object is connected to. They are instance-specific.

Outside the TerrariumStatus Class:

send_temperature(temp, host, port): This function takes the temperature data and sends it to another system (the fan controller). 
    It doesn't need to know anything about the TerrariumStatus object itself. It's a general-purpose function for sending data. 
    It's an action that uses the temperature data.

log_sensor_data(): This function is the orchestrator. It uses the TerrariumStatus to get the data, but it also handles other tasks: 
    saving to the database, and controlling the motor. It's at a higher level of logic, managing the overall process. 
    It uses the class to get part of its job done.

fetch_sensor_data_process(queue): This function is a helper for multiprocessing. It's designed to run in a separate process, create a TerrariumStatus, 
get the data, and pass the data back. It's about how to run the data fetching, not the fetching itself.

main(): This function is the main entry point of the script.

Analogy:

Think of a car:

The TerrariumStatus class is like the car's engine.

__init__ is like assembling the engine.

fetch_data is like the engine running and producing power.

The functions outside the class are like:

send_temperature: The car's speedometer sending speed information to a display.

log_sensor_data: A driver who starts the engine, drives the car, and records the journey.

fetch_sensor_data_process: A mechanic who puts the engine on a test bench to measure its output.

main(): Starting the car.

The engine (class) has its own functions, and the driver (other functions) uses the engine to achieve a goal.
